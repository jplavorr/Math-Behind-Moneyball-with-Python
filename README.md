# Math-Behind-Moneyball-with-Python
In this repository I will start a series, based on Coursera's 'Math Behind Moneyball' course (which is about Data Science in sports). I will reproduce the content seen in the course using Python and drawing conclusions from the data.

**Background in:** Mathematics, Python, Machine Learning and Applied Math.
